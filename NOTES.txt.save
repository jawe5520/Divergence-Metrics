Line 1147: 
call to buildFitnessArray uses the address of the 0th element of fitnessArray; I've changed it from &fitnessArray[0] to simply fitnessArray. Is that cool?

Line 1136:
Declaration of fitnessArray as an array of doubles. Cool?

Line 1077:
What's the deal with the alive_svalues array?

Line 1159/1160:
Access fitness array with brackets and address; fix

Line 1054:
Removed aliveTracker[deadTracker] = i line; irrelevant? Check

Line 133:
Defining selectionCoefficients as double* : yay or nay?

--------------------------

Notes:

--------------------------

-Edit Cutoff function declaration:

double Cutoff(double* selectionCoefficients, double* viabilityArray)
=>
double Cutoff (double viabilityArray)


-Edit variable fitnessArray:

double fitnessArray[TOTAL_N];
=>
double *fitnessArray;

Lines 1159/1160:
momi = pickParent( &fitnessArray[0], -1, n ); // -1 = flag for parent not chosen yet
dadi = pickParent( &fitnessArray[0], momi, n );

-Build helper function to walk to index n 
-Pass index of first fitnessArray element to function, use to parse to helper function from within program? //Later note: fitnessArray being replaced with
selectionCoefficients, an indexed array, makes this irrelevant

-Alternatively: change presence of fitnessArray in function declarations (only place used) into selectionCoefficients array? (includes pickParent)

Lines 1159/1160:

&fitnessArray[0] -> &selectionCoefficients[0]
Check to make sure that selectionCoefficients has been passed properly!
Currently using brackets- is that the best way to proceed? (Certainly the easiest)

Walker function built; prototype added. Not debugged

buildFitnessArray function has double* fitnessArray as an argument. Changing to double* selectionCoefficients on initial pass; check to see if this 
argument is necessary

Added check for siteTypeProbabilities exceeding 1 (line 370, buildFitnessArray)

Removed double* fitnessArray argument from buildFitnessArray (unnecessary)

selectionCoefficients declared as global double*. Will this be suitable when it's accessed as an indexed array?

in pickParent: s_total_i replaced with s_total in all cases; resets upon incrementation of outer for loop
